Since the summer of 1967, RSCM choir courses have enriched the lives of
thousands of young singers and their choir directors, church, school, and
community choirs across the United States and Canada. Our course has
contributed to the summer offerings since 1996. Our motto, *Psallam spiritu et
mente*, &#8220;I will sing with the spirit and with the understanding
also,&#8221; underscores the many opportunities for musical mountaintop
experiences to young and old alike.

Participants will enjoy daily small group rehearsals with their housemaster.
The housemasters are acclaimed choral directors that are on staff to work with
each group, or house, of girls or adults. Ear training and one on one coaching
are also available for those interested.

The girls live together in the dorm and enjoy games, crafts, and social
activities. Many participants come back year after year to reunite with their
RSCM friends and even talk about other courses they have attended.

Each day winds down with a service of Evensong utilizing the music learned so
far. Dinner, social time, and perhaps an organ concert follow.
