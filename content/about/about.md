This course features opportunities to sing the finest sacred SATB repertoire
with the highest standards of musical performance, conducted by internationally
recognized musicians, balanced with a full complement of structured
recreational and social activities.

Additionally, choirmasters and organists both will be enriched by

  * organ recitals by acclaimed organist
  * sessions on choir and vocal technique building.

Girls will also have opportunities to increase reading and singing ability through

  * daily ear training sessions and
  * daily small group voice coachings.

The course is housed on the campus of [Saint Mary’s School][1], an exceptional
girls’ school located in Raleigh, North Carolina, which combines historic charm
with modern conveniences, such as air-conditioned dormitories and an indoor
