The RSCM is an ecumenical Christian charity that is dedicated to the highest
quality church music.Â  The core purpose of the RSCM is education.

Through its educational mission the RSCM aims to encourage and inspire:

  * Good use of music, above all, in Christian worship
  * The highest standards appropriate to each individual church and community,
    taking into account resources and circumstances
  * A culture of learning through practice, experience and reflection, leading
    to the development of both skills and understanding
  * Individuals to engage in education and training in order to serve their
    church or community, and to fulfill the RSCM's mission at a local level.

## The RSCM as organization

The RSCM consists of an international network of affiliated groups and
individual members, coordinated nationally and/or regionally through voluntary
committees, guided, enabled and supported by an administrative staff, with an
administrative center at Sarum College near Salisbury Cathedral. Common to
everyone in the RSCM is the belief that music, and specifically music in
worship, matters.
