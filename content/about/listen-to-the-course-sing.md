Each summer at the Carolina Course, the choristers and adults have the opportunity
to sing selections they may otherwise never experience. Sometimes these
selections allow the choristers and adults an opportunity to sing, successfully,
music they may once have considered impossible. As the week ends and the choristers
and adults gather for festival Eucharist and Evensong, the words of Psalm 100
are embodied:

> Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth. Worship
> the Lord with gladness; come into his presence with singing.

Listen to the worship and song of the Carolina Course by clicking on the
appropriate file type, listed below each selection. Enjoy.
