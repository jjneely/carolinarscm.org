Thanks to all the staff and participants of the 2016 RSCM Carolina Course!   It
is truly inspiring to spend a summer week in Raleigh, NC with all of you.  A
special thanks to the parents, churches, and musicians that teach and support
these fine young women.

# Photos and Videos

We will post the official course pictures on this website and on Facebook when
we receive them.  It usually takes a few weeks for our photographer to select
and edit them.  We do not mail out hard photos, but we will have high
resolution images on the website.

You can watch the Closing Evensong at Duke Chapel on YouTube!
