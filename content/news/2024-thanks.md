What a fantastic course!  A special thank you to all the parents, teachers,
and mentors of our participants in 2024.  You make their journey possible, and
how far and fast they have come!  A special thank you to our outgoing manager,
Matthew Brown who is passing the baton to Dr. Mark Ardrey-Graves for 2025.
Also, thanks go to our music director Nick Quardokus and organist James
Kealey.  We hope to see all of you in 2025!  Video links and pictures are
