The 2015 RSCM Carolina Course is now open for applications for girls and adults!  This year&#8217;s course will be held July 13 &#8211; 19 at Saint Mary&#8217;s School in Raleigh, NC.  This year marks the 20th annual RSCM Carolina Course!  Our music director will be Simon Lole who originally directed this course 20 years ago.  Course organist will be Zachary Hemenway.

You can find all of your forms and pricing information on our [Registration Information page][1].  The music for this year can be found on the [Repertoire page][2].  Quite a bit of this year&#8217;s music is freely downloadable from the Repertoire page as well.

All of us are looking forward to seeing you in July!
