We were heartbroken to have to cancel our in-person summer training course for
2021 but are excited to announce that [registration][2] is now open for RSCMA's
virtual offering, "The Spirit’s Tether." In registering for this course,
participants will have the opportunity to:

* Engage in seminars for organists, vocalists, adults, and children alike with world renowned musicians
* Participate in RSCMA's virtual choir broadcast
* Engage with the RSCMA community through virtual social offerings

Please [reach out to us][1] with any questions.

We can’t wait to see you!
