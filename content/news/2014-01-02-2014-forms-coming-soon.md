Happy New Year to one and all!

Very soon we should have the registration materials on the website for the 2014 course. Please check back here for the latest information.

We are limited to the first 35 girls, so the first ones to get their deposit money will be in the course! The girls, proctors and some staff will be housed at Saint Mary&#8217;s School. The remaining adults will be housed at the Doubletree Inn on Hillsborough Street right down the road from the school. We are lucky that Saint Mary&#8217;s decided to not renovate all the dorms this summer!

Please feel free to email the registrar or course manager with any questions that you may have concerning the course. Contact information is on the [contact page][1].

Thank you and we look forward to hearing and talking with many of you soon!
