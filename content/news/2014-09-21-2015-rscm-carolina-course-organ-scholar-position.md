Dear Colleagues,

The Royal School of Church Music in America&#8217;s Carolina Summer Training  
Course will celebrate its 20th anniversary in Raleigh, North Carolina July  
13-19, 2015.

Held annually on the beautiful campus of Raleigh&#8217;s St. Mary&#8217;s School, this  
course is known for a high standard of musical excellence, organization, and  
gracious hospitality. We are pleased to welcome Mr. Simon Lole  
(www.simonlole.com) from the United Kingdom as this year&#8217;s music director.

The course is currently seeking applications for one organ scholar between  
age 18 and 25. This unique opportunity allows a currently matriculating  
student and aspiring church musician to grow in their knowledge of sacred  
music, choir training for children and adults, hymn playing, and organ  
accompaniment. Mr. Zachary Hemenway, a graduate of the Eastman School of  
Music and Yale University, will serve as our 2015 Course Organist. The organ  
scholar will learn valuable lessons by observing and participating in the  
daily activities of the course.

Please see the attached flyer and share with your local AGO chapters,  
colleagues and friends. The RSCM Carolina Course offers complimentary  
registration, housing, and meals for the duration of the course.

The organ scholar will be expected to attend all course-related activities  
and work closely with the music director and organist. Opportunities to play  
voluntaries, hymns and accompaniments are available.

If you have any questions, please contact us via our [contact page][1].
