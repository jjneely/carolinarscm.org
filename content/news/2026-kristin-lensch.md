Kristin Lensch serves as organist-choirmaster at Calvary Episcopal Church, Memphis. She oversees a vibrant music program consisting of four choirs, a Friends of Music concert series, monthly Evensong services, and tri-annual residencies at English cathedrals. She holds degrees from The University of Iowa, Indiana University, and The University of Memphis. She maintains a private organ studio, is active in the Royal School of Church Music America and the Association of Anglican Musicians, and serves the American Guild of Organists as its Southeast Regional Ambassador.

When she's not thinking about all things musical, Kristin likes to run, eat (which causes her to run more), garden, read interesting books with her book group, FaceTime with her "grown and flown" children (daughter Sloan in Philadelphia, and son Charlie in Washington, D.C.), and spend time with her husband Tim Huebner, and Scout the Cat.
