Videos of our closing services and the course photo are now here!

We wish to thank all of the staff and participants of the 2018 RSCM Carolina
Course!   It was truly inspiring to spend a week at Duke University with all of
you. A special thanks to our director, Martin Baker from Westminster Cathedral,
for coming and making wonderful music with us! We also wish to thank all of the
parents, churches, and musicians that teach and support the fine young women
that attended. We are looking forward to next year and will be in touch when we
have selected the music director for 2019.
