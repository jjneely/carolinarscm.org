We wish to thank all of the staff and participants of the 2023 RSCM Carolina
Summer Residency!  It was truly inspiring to spend a week at Duke University
with all of you. A special thanks to our director, Matthew Owens, organist
Käthe Wright Kaufman, and manager Matthew Brown! We also wish to thank all of
the parents, churches, and musicians that teach and support the fine young
women that attended. We are looking forward to seeing all of you next year!
