Dear Friends,

We write to share the disappointing news that the RSCM Carolina Course (July
13-19, 2020) has been cancelled due to the ongoing uncertainties of the
COVID-19 pandemic and communications we have received from Duke University's
Conference Services department.

As you know, this summer was to be the 25th anniversary of the Carolina Course.
For many of us, this annual course is the highlight of our summers. Our
decision to cancel was not easy, but one we believe supports the overall health
and welfare of our course participants, staff, and the larger Duke campus
community.

Anyone who has already registered and submitted a deposit or paid in full is
entitled to a full refund. Marilyn will be sending you a refund within the next
week. If you have any questions, please contact her at marilyn.neely@gmail.com.

As always, thank you for your support of the RSCM and particularly the Carolina
Course. We intend to stay in touch and will keep you posted as plans develop
for the 25th anniversary course next summer.

Sincerely,

Matthew Brown, Course Manager  
Marilyn Neely, Registrar
