Established in 2015, *The Kerstetter Scholarship* honors the extraordinary
leadership and devotion of Kevin Kerstetter to the RSCMA Carolina Summer
Training Course. This annual scholarship, given through the generosity of an
anonymous donor, provides course tuition for a deserving chorister with a
demonstrated need each year. ï¿¼

Scholarship requests remain confidential and are considered on a first come
first serve basis. Scholarship applications are considered without
discrimination by the course registrar and manager.

A recommendation form, submitted by the chorister's music director, is required
by the application deadline for consideration. A chorister may receive the
scholarship only once. Requesting beneficiaries may not submit consecutive
applications, unless otherwise approved at the discretion of the course
registrar. All scholarship applicants must be currently involved with a
RSCM-affiliated program.

For more information, please contact the [course registrar][1].
