Greetings from your webmaster and welcome to the very new web site for the RSCM Carolina Course for Girls and Adults.  You&#8217;ll find information about next years course (when announced) at the top of the page under &#8220;Course Information&#8221; as well as on the right.  Details about this course, and the RSCM, can be found in the [About][1] page.

The image used as the header is the 2006 course picture in front of Duke Chapel.  The back ground image is several measures of Charles Wood&#8217;s &#8220;O Thou The Central Orb&#8221; as found in the [Choral Public Domain Library][2].
