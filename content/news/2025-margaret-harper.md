Margaret Harper is the Director of Music at Trinity Episcopal Church in
Princeton, NJ. At Trinity, she oversees a landmark Episcopal music program,
including multiple choirs that have released critically acclaimed recordings
over the years. Before coming to Trinity, Margaret served churches in Texas,
New York, Illinois, and New Hampshire. She was founding manager of the
RSCM America's Dallas Boys Course and founding director of the Choir School at
St. John's in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. 

Margaret also maintains an active schedule as a solo performer and a guest
conductor. She has been hailed by *The Diapason* magazine for her "impeccable"
playing and by the *Boston Musical Intelligencer* for "outstandingly lively,
punchy" performances. Croatian newspaper *Glas Slavonije* writes, "The freezing
cold of a January evening dominated the cathedral in Djakovo, but it could not
diminish the richness and warmth of sound brought out of the cathedral organ
by Margaret Harper." Summer concerts in 2024 brought her to England and
Germany, and the 2024-2025 season will include trips across the US and to
Sweden.

Margaret has also served on faculty at Baylor University and the University of
Southern Maine, teaching organ and harpsichord. Margaret holds a DMA and a
Performerâ€™s Certificate from the Eastman School of Music. She has served in
leadership roles for various chapters of the American Guild of Organists, the
Association of Anglican Musicians, and the Royal School of Church Music -
America. She has presented papers and given recitals at conferences of several
national organizations, including the American Guild of Organists, Organ
Historical Society, Association of Anglican Musicians, and American Bach
Society.
