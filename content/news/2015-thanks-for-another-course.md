Thanks to all the staff and participants of the 2015 RSCM Carolina Course!   It
is truly inspiring to spend a summer week in Raleigh, NC with all of you.  A
special thanks to the parents, churches, and musicians that teach and support
these fine young women.  The 20th RSCM Carolina Course has been the best yet!

We will post the official course pictures on this website and on Facebook when
we receive them.  It usually takes a few weeks for our photographer to select
and edit them.  We do not mail out hard photos, but we will have high
resolution images on the website hard copies can be ordered from our
photographer.
