Thanks to all participants, parents, staff members, musicians, and all who supported and made the 2013 RSCM Carolina Course a truly wonderful success!  Our [documentary film project][1] is off to a fantastic start and the whole community of Raleigh is a buzz with the music offered at the closing services Sunday.

Please take a moment to fill out the [course evaluation][2].  You can find the password in your 2013 course binder on page 13.
