Videos of our closing services and the course photo are now here!

We wish to thank all of the staff and participants of the 2019 RSCM Carolina
Course!   It was truly inspiring to spend a week at Duke University with all of
you. A special thanks to our director, Dr. Jared Johnson, Canon Organist and
Choirmaster of Columbia's Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, for coming and making
wonderful music with us! We also wish to thank all of the parents, churches,
and musicians that teach and support the fine young women that attended. We are
looking forward to next year and will be in touch when we have selected the
music director for 2020.
