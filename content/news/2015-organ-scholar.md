Congratulations to Richard Gray for being selected as the 2015 Organ Scholar. A
native of Beaufort, SC, Richard is currently completing undergraduate studies
as a student of Professor James David Christie at the Oberlin College
Conservatory of Music. In the fall of 2012, he studied organ with Oberlin’s
Distinguished Visiting Professor of Organ, Marie-Louise Langlais. Further
studies have been at the McGill Summer Organ Academy with John Grew. An active
recitalist, Richard has performed at notable venues including National City
Christian Church in Washington, DC, Church of the Little Flower in Bethesda,
MD, and The Cathedral Church of St. Luke and St. Paul in Charleston, SC, where
he was a featured artist in the L’Organo Series of the 2014 Piccolo Spoleto
Festival. After completing his studies at Oberlin, Richard will pursue graduate
studies with Stefan Engels at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.

The 2015 Carolina Course is pleased to welcome Richard to its musical
leadership this summer!
