The 2011 Carolina RSCM Course for Girls and Adults will be held once again at [St. Mary&#8217;s School][1] in Raleigh, NC.  Mark your calendar for July 11th &#8211; 17th, 2011!

This year our music director will be Richard Webster from Trinity Church, Boston.  Matthew Brown from First United Methodist Church, Salisbury, NC will return as our organist.

On July 17th we will sing Eucharist at historic [Christ Church][2] in down town Raleigh.  The closing Evensong will be at [Hayes Barton United Methodist Church][3] and will feature their John-Paul Buzard 52 rank pipe organ, Opus 39, completed in June 2010!
