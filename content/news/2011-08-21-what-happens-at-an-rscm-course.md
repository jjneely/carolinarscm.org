Lots of folks ask &#8220;What goes on at an RSCM course?&#8221; Well, lots of music and rehearsal time of course. But that&#8217;s not all we do. Our participants form a community together, grow with one another, and have lots of fun. This video shows a lot of the non-rehearsal happenings from the 2011 RSCM Carolina Course for Choristers and Adults.

This video was lovingly produced by 2011 participant Makenzie Owens.
