Following the successful 25th anniversary of the RSCM Carolina Course at Duke
University, we are eager to continue providing new and returning participants
the best experience each summer.
The ongoing success of the Carolina Course exists because of generous
contributions made by participants, sponsoring parishes, and friends each
year.

The Carolina Course invites your consideration in joining the Friends of the
