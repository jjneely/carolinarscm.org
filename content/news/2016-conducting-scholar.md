The 2016 RSCM Carolina Course is pleased to offer another exciting initiative
for a **CONDUCTING SCHOLAR** at this year's course. Designed for an advanced
conducting student or organist who wishes to hone his/her choral conducting
skills, the Conducting Scholar will have several opportunities to lead
rehearsals for course participants and possibly conduct a segment of repertoire
presented during the closing services.

<!--more-->

The Conducting Scholar should be between ages 18 and 25 and exhibit tremendous
maturity and professionalism. During the weeklong course, the Conducting
Scholar will grow in his/her knowledge of sacred music (including Anglican
chant), choir training for children, youth, and adults, and benefit from
meaningful conversations with renowned Course Chaplain, Dr. William Bradley
Roberts of Virginia Theological Seminary. Dr. Michael Velting, Canon for Music
at Nashville's Christ Church Cathedral is the music director.

Please see the attached flyer and share with your students, colleagues and
friends. The RSCM Carolina Course offers complimentary registration, housing,
and meals for the duration of the course. The Conducting Scholar is expected to
attend all course-related activities and work closely with the music director,
organist, chaplain, and housemasters.
