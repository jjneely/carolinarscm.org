In 2013 we had the largest course in several years with over 50 girl
participants.  Our film documentary project was in full swing with producers
Robin Arcus and Tod Tinkham.  Our music director this year was the incredible
Dr. David Hill.  We welcome back Dr. David Arcus as the course organist.  The
Rev. Nancy Allison graced us with her skilled preaching.  Finally, our organ
scholar was Stephen Gourley.

The repertoire for the 2013 course was as follows:

**Eucharist**

  * *The Office of the Holy Communion (Collegium Regale)*, Herbert Howells
  * *The Lord is my Shepherd*, Lennox Berkeley
  * *Ave verum corpus*, William Byrd (ATB only)

**Evensong**

  * *Ex ore innocentium*, John Ireland (Trebles only)
  * Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis in C, Sir Charles Villiers Stanford
  * Preces and Responses, William Smith
  * *Te Deum (Collegium Regale)*, Herbert Howells
