The 2011 RSCM Carolina Course for Girl&#8217;s and Adults was graced by Richard
Webster from Trinity Church, Boston, as our music director.  We also hosted
Matthew Brown from First United Methodist Church, Salisbury, NC as our
organist.  Let&#8217;s not forget the Rev. Nancy Allison who served as our
chaplain.  Special mention goes to our organ scholar this year, Chris Pharo.

The repertoire for the 2011 course was as follows.

  * George Dyson – *Magnificat & Nunc dimittis in D Major*
  * Thomas Tomkins – *Preces & Responses*
  * Richard Webster – *Missa Dorica*
  * Herbert Howells – *Hymn for St. Cecilia*
  * C. V. Stanford – *A Song of Freedom (Bible Songs)*
  * Kenneth Leighton – *O sacrum convivium*
  * Richard Webster – *Come, O thou traveler unknown*
  * Plus psalms, hymns and descants

Lots of photos are available from this course.  Take a look at our [Google
Picasa Slide Show][3].
